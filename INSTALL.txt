Building Camera module of Fast Visualization Kit (FVK)
------------------------------------------------------

More detailed build instructions can be found in the documentation,
this section is just for the inpatient among you.

CMake is the preferred build system for FVK-CAMERA. The minimum required version 
is 2.8.11. If you don't have it yet, downloads for CMake can be found on
http://www.cmake.org/. 

Building FVK-CAMERA with CMake is 'business as usual' if you've used CMake before. All steps can be done either on the command line shell or by using the CMake GUI tool, the choice is up to you. 

First, invoke CMake to generate build files for a particular
toolchain (for standard GNU makefiles: cmake -G 'Unix Makefiles').
Afterwards, use the generated build files to perform the actual
build. 

Required Libraries:
OpenCV greater than or equal 2.4
(prebuild libraries that can be found in lib folder was built with OpenCV v4.1.0)

Before building FVK-CAMERA, you should have built the OpenCV first then specify the OpenCV build folder in CMake, and you are done.
