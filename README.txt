The Fast Visualization Kit (FVK) is a software package for 3D computer graphics, image processing, and visualization. It consists of a C++ class library with several 3D geometric as well as vision algorithms. It provides C++ classes for 2D-to-3D conversion algorithms specifically for DFP based structured light technology, various algorithm for mesh and pointcloud processig, and a complete software
interface for developing fast 3D graphics and vision based applications. 
FVK supports visualization algorithms including scalar, vector, texture, and volumetric methods, as well as advanced modeling techniques such as implicit modeling, polygon reduction, mesh smoothing, cutting, contouring, and Delaunay triangulation.

The FVK-CAMERA is one of its modules that gives multithreading based
camera handlings using OpenCV. It can be utilized with any GUI based library to 
handle multiple cameras with multithreaded interface.
